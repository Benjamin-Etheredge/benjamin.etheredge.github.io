# Deep-Q with Atari

# WRITTING IN PROGRESS

## TLDR


## Introduction
I specifially called this project "Deep-Q with Atari" instead of "Atari with Deep-Q" as the main goal was getting more familiar with deep-Q learning through the more difficult task of playing Atari games. 

I had just finished an assignement where I rushed to implement a deep-Q agent for the lunar lander gym environment for 
my CS-XXXX: Reinforcement Learning course. I wanted
